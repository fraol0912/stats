Stored here to conserve it for history.

Our math teacher told us we could use a calculator on a test. So i made a specified calculator that had everything i needed for that test. So it wasn't actually cheating. In case anybody came by to my desk during the test, I made a feature that would allow me to double click on the screen and a calculator would appear so that the person that came by would think i was using a regular calculator.

## Main Features

- transform a list of discrete data points and divide them into classes
- get a list of classes and generate statistical values from them

## Can Calculate

It can calculate the following values from a set of grouped data:

- Deciles
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Percentile
- Quartile
- Range
- Standard Deviation
- Variance

## Technologies

- Used ChakraUI for interface

## Easter Egg

- When you double click on the screen a calculator appears
